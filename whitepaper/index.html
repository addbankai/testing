  <section id="long-term">
    <h2>Long-Term Vision & Unique Features</h2>
    <p>
      Our long-term vision is to deliver a game where infinite possibilities meet infinite capabilities—a game that grows and evolves with its community through continuous updates, immersive simulation, and dynamic RPG progression.
    </p>
    <p>
      A key aspect of our future is the integration of the upcoming token <strong>$Hero</strong>, which will play a pivotal role in our in-game economy. The utilities and capabilities of $Hero include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hero Capsule Purchases:</strong> $Hero will be primarily required to buy and purchase Hero Capsules, essential items for character progression and customization.</li>
      <li><strong>Phoenix Treasure Chest:</strong> Use $Hero to unlock exclusive Phoenix Treasure Chests, offering rare items and bonuses.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketplace Currency:</strong> $Hero serves as a versatile currency in our Marketplace, enabling players to buy various resources to fuel their empire’s growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Resource Building Boost:</strong> Temporarily speed up any resource building by using $Hero as a booster currency, ensuring rapid expansion during critical gameplay moments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By integrating $Hero into every facet of the game, we aim to create an economy that not only supports but enhances the dynamic interplay between empire building and hero development.
